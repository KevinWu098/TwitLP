# TwitLP
TwitLonger Paraphraser - A Twitter Bot (soon<sup>tm</sup> to be implemented) for when TwitLonger gets too Longer

## Disclaimer ‚ÄºÔ∏è
No paraphrased text will ever maintain the exact details, intent, or content of the original text; and in some cases, such as with often highly-"jargonized" Twitlongers, this bot's paraphrasing may be... passable at best and unintentionally misleading at worse. If something sounds too good (or dumb) to be true, please please refer to the actual Twitlonger. 

## Introduction
TwitLP is your best friend when you're, quite frankly, too lazy to click a link and read more than 280 characters. Don't worry, we get it. That's why TwitLP is here to make sure that your ever-shortening attention span can handle the latest Twitlonger on the timeline.

Using Google's Bard and some web scraping with Beautiful Soup, TwitLP aims to concisely summarize a TL back down to 280 characters.
